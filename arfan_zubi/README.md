# Arfan Zubi Rust Tutorials

[Learn Rust Programming - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/BpPEoZW5IiY?si=sd6NtZ3LT1vOb2R2)

## Course Work

 - Improved my methods of running exercises from the commandline by adding a struct and implementing it in the binary.
 - Improved my method of keeping course sections together by giving each section an empty struct name and implementing it with each exercise as a non returning function.
 - Arfan like some python courses I have watched, takes you trough the basics of how binary operation works.
 - He covers topics with both visual explanations and exercises.
 - In the last 3 hours of the course Arfan shows how to use rust on your computer. All exercises up to that point where run using the rust playground.
 - At this point he explains how many binaries and libraries you can have and how to split modules in to files and subfolders with a mod.rs file to link all other files from that subfolder.
 - Therefore, I renamed exercises.rs to exercises_original.rs and copied its contents into individual files within a newly created exercises subfolder. Everthing still worked the same, so that was a very helpfull lesson.
