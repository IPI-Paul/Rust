# Course Work
 - Started out by putting comments of Ryan's helpful tips above lines of code then moved to numbering comments and referencing them.
 - Would like to know if there is a way to click on the references to comments to take the user straight to the comment without having to scroll all the way through the code.... and posibly back to the line of code being commented on.
 - The first time I watched these videos, I just did not get it. After watching some other introductions to rust, I found these tutorials very helpful and easy to follow.
 - These tutorials give futher insight in to how the cargo build, check and run functions work.
 - One thing to note though, is that calling ./target/release/app_name does not create a new database in the target folder and also does not read the database in the current folder. So, will have to learn how to apply relative paths currently not part of the course material.
 - Some of the libraries created were only tested and I would have liked to see use cases.
