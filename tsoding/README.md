## Course Work

 - Learning rust for the first time I wanted to know how to take the user input of a number and combine it with a string to call a function with a name that matches that combination. 
 - Episodes 1 to 2 were easy to follow along and the subject matter is something I have wondered about in the past when writing VBA macros and developing functions in other programming langauges.
 - Episode 3 did not cover all the changes tsoding had made, and rather labouriously, I paused the video every time he scrolled through the code and moved the video frame by frame until I got all the changes to enable me to then follow along.
 - Episodes 4, 5 and 6 again did not cover all the changes and this time I used the github history to track the changes and update the code to the point I thought the video was starting from. Unfortunately, due to not compiling in the history for episode 4 I copied historical changes that were ahead of the episode start.

 ## Course Work

  - This course gives further insight into the workings of TCP and sockets.
  - tsoding carried out a DDOS attack on the app being built and when following along and using the terminal in VS Code (Codium), it brought my system to a halt. Running both the App and the attack in the Linux terminal emulator did not bring the system to a halt.
  - Having learnt how to build a Web App in Go and finding it quite easy, I am now interested to see if the same can be achieved in Rust.
  - The Go App tsoding built and converted only used 158 lines of code, but in Rust it used 189 lines plus an additional line I thought preferrable.
  - The discussion around Go Telemetry puts me off studying Go any further and it would be good to find further tutorials on building Rust solutions.
  - It would be good to learn more on building GUIs in Rust as the Warp YouTube video indicates that this is an area that needs vast improvement.
