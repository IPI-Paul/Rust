## Course Work

 - Learning rust for the first time I wanted to know how to take the user input of a number and combine it with a string to call a function with a name that matches that combination. 
 - Episodes 1 to 2 were easy to follow along and the subject matter is something I have wondered about in the past when writing VBA macros and developing functions in other programming langauges.
 - Episode 3 did not cover all the changes tsoding had made, and rather labouriously, I paused the video every time he scrolled through the code and moved the video frame by frame until I got all the changes to enable me to then follow along.
 - Episodes 4, 5 and 6 again did not cover all the changes and this time I used the github history to track the changes and update the code to the point I thought the video was starting from. Unfortunately, due to not compiling in the history for episode 4 I copied historical changes that were ahead of the episode start.
