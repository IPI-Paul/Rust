# Derek Banas Rust Tutorials

[Rust tutorial full course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ygL_xcavzQ4)

# Course Work

 - These 2 courses are basically the same, with one being an extension of the other that covers more material.
 - Setting up rust on my linux system was easy once I learnt that I had to rename the .bashrc file temporarily, as it was causing the installation to fail due to a premissions error.
 - In order to maintain all the code for future reference I added each tutorial to an example function and gave the user the chance to select which example to run from main.rs.
 - I searched online for a way to dynamically call the example functions like using VBAs eval() function, but as rust is compiled before running the web results I found did not make sense to me.
